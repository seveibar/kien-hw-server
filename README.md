# Kien Homework Server

The Kien Homework Server is a language-agnostic submission platform for universities that would like to automatically grade student assignments.

Kien is currently being ported from it's old location, as a result, the documentation has not yet been moved.

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/seveibar/kien-hw-server/wiki) as it is populated!
